**💡 Simple Rule of Thumb**

🧠 Use for inside while when your logic depends on levels. (Useful for: Level-order, zigzag, average-per-level)
                      
    🔹 Use _for_ loop → when your answer depends on levels.
🧠 Use only while when you just need to process all nodes. (Useful for: Invert tree, search, simple BFS)     
  
    🔹 Use only _while_ → when your answer depends only on all nodes.
